I'm currently a Part III student at the University of Cambridge studying Astrophysics, which is just an excuse to do some mathematics and simulate it on computers. My star sign is Pisces. 

More broadly I'm interested in the intersection of maths + physics + biology + computing. This website is an overview of *some* of the stuff I get up to.

In a previous life, I spent a year as an intern in a software company and before that I worked as a mathematics teaching assistant supporting GCSE pupils. 

My hobbies include film-photography, films and photography. I'm also a keen 5k runner but incapable of running any other distance.
