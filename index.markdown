I'm currently a <a href="https://martingale.foundation/scholarships/mathematical-sciences/">Martingale Scholar</a> at the University of Manchester, studying the 12 month Pure Mathematics MSc (9 months taught, 3 months dissertation). I'm specialising in analysis/geometry and plan to write my dissertation on the <a href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/analysis-geometry-and-dynamical-systems/">analysis of dynamical systems</a> (likely using some geometric tools).

More broadly, I'm interested in the intersection of maths + physics + biology + computing. This website is an overview of some of the stuff I get up to.

Previously I studied Part III Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge and before that I spent a year as in a software company and another year as a mathematics teaching assistant supporting GCSE pupils. 

My hobbies include film-photography, films and photography. I'm also a keen 5k runner.
