I've written a 15 page introduction to topology as part of my MSc in Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester. The task was to write a 12-16 page report on an undergraduate level topic as practice for the summer dissertation. Since I was already comfortable writing Latex but have never been allowed to attend a taught course on topology, this seemed like a good opportunity to fill in some gaps for myself: [download pdf](/documents/ManchesterMiniProjectHarveyWilliams.pdf).
